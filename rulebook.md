## Rules

### General
- black is always first to move
- pieces are placed on every black field, except the 2 middle rows, no matter the boardsize
- a player can not jump over his own pieces
- NP become CP when they reach the opposite end of the board of the other player
- a player has won when the other player has no more pieces

### Move Rules
- each piece can only move on black fields
- NP can only move forward diagonally (they cannot move or capture backwards under any circumstance)
- CP can move freely in any diagonal direction

### Capture Rules  
- a capture is only valid, if there is space behind the piece that is going to be captured  
- while performing a capture, one is not allowed to jump over his own pieces, no matter if NP or CP
- NP can only capture forward diagonally, not backwards (applies to chained captures as well)  
- CP can capture in any diagonal direction, as long as there is at least one free field after each capture(the length between the CP and to be captured piece does not matter)
